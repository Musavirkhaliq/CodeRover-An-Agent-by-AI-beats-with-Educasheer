# 🤖 Coding Agent with Memory and RL

This project implements a **coding agent** that can:
- Use **memory** (including a neural network–based memory store).
- Learn better workflows via **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**.
- Orchestrate between **tools**, a **decision-making LLM**, and a **code-writing LLM**.
- Continuously improve how it selects **which workflow** and **which memories** to use.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coding-agent.git
cd coding-agent
````

### 2. Set up environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure API Keys

* Copy `.env.example` → `.env`
* Add keys for your LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, local LLaMA)

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## 🧠 Components

### Orchestrator

The **brain** of the system.

* Plans workflows.
* Decides which memory and tools to use.

### Memory

* **Neural network–based memory** for storing context.
* **Vector store** for fast retrieval.
* Helps agent reuse past experiences.

### LLMs

* **Orchestrator LLM** → reasoning, planning, tool selection.
* **Code Writer LLM** → writes/debugs code.

### Tools

* Sandbox code executor.
* File manager.
* Web/document search.
* Extendable with custom tools.

### RL Training

* Defines environment (`environment.py`)
* Optimizes policy for **workflow selection** and **memory usage**.

## 🛠 Usage

Run the agent:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

Train with RL:

```bash
python src/rl/trainer.py
```

Run tests:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## 🧪 Roadmap

* [ ] Implement basic orchestrator loop.
* [ ] Add memory NN integration.
* [ ] RL-based workflow optimization.
* [ ] Expand toolset (web search, debugging assistant).
* [ ] Add persistence layer for long-term memory.
